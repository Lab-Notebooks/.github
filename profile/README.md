## Laboratory Notebooks

This page contains active and archival laboratory notebooks for computational experiments that use various open source simulation software systems. The laboratory notebooks consists of execution environments to replicate published results on HPC systems.

- Active Repositories: These repositories contain current projects that are actively being modified, updated, and undergoing scientific investigation and collaboration.
- Archived Repositories: These repositories contain projects that are either set aside for future investigations, or have been used in publications and are being preserved for reproducibility.

The repositories use (https://github.com/Lab-Notebooks/Jobrunner) as a tool to manage directory-based inhertiance to stitch together scientific workflows. To reproduce an experiment simply fork the associated repository and follow instructions to setup the environment. To contribute to the exiting repositories either create a pull request or file an issue under (https://github.com/Lab-Notebooks/.github) (for archived repositories only).
